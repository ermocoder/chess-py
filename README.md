Chess AI written in Python

## About
This is my attempt to create a program that plays chess.

The most interesting thing for me was to develop a strategy for choosing the best move. Therefore, I designed an algorithm for position estimation and several procedures of the game tree analysis.

The implementation of chess rules (storing position, generating moves, etc.) was not so interesting, so I used the ready-made python-chess library.

The user interface was not within the scope of the project at all. The program has a text interface for input/output of moves. You can play, for example, by placing a physical board next to the computer.

#### What for
Just for fun. I like both chess and programming. Therefore, my natural desire was to write a program that plays chess.
